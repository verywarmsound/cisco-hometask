# Project Title

This project consists of two main tasks. One is located in the `backend` folder and the other in the `python-tasks` folder.

## Backend Task

The backend task involves writing an HTTP server with a REST API using Node.js and TypeScript. The server helps organize documents into different groups called "tags". Each document is represented by a URI and can have multiple tags. Tags form a hierarchy, so each tag can have sub-tags.

This task is located in the `backend` folder and is written in Node.js and TypeScript.

For more details, please refer to the `README.md` file in the `backend` folder:

## Python Tasks

The Python tasks involve various coding exercises, including working with graphs and counting words in a text file.
